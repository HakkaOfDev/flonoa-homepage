    insect_style: {
      introduction: 'Insect style is a school project. We had to create an identity for invitations to a fashion show centered on insects. We had to simplify the shapes of an insect to make a pattern and transcribe it on the invitation.',
      maquette1: 'I chose the butterfly because it is an insect that I find very graceful and inspiring. So the first step was to simplify several butterfly cheeses. ',
      maquette2: 'I chose a shape that I then multiplied several times to create a pattern.',
      maquette3: 'I chose red, black and white because they are chic and elegant colors used in the fashion world.',
      conclusion: 'So here is the invitation I created for the fashion show. I placed the text in the center so that our eye is directly drawn to it, then I placed the butterflies on the sides to frame the important information. '

    soundlab: {
      introduction: 'Sound Lab is a school project. We had to create a poster, adaptable on a phone, on a social network and as a flyer, for a new space that allowed to create music. Here are several posters I created.',

    paper_couv: {
      introduction: 'Paper Couv\' is a school project. We had to create a front cover of a Jules Verne book only with paper and in three dimensions and then take a picture. The photo will be the first cover. I chose to illustrate the story of "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea."',
      conclusion: 'I used mainly collage and cutting techniques. To give relief, I cut thin strips of paper that I rolled up and glued on the edge. I then glued a blue sheet with holes, the superimposed sheets are darker and darker as to imitate the depths.'
    },
    sewn_designs: {
      introduction: 'This is a personal project. I was inspired by drawings in the same style. I first put tape on the edges of the sheet, then a strip across the sheet as I wanted. I then painted the side I wanted with a color, drew a shape over it and then with a needle made small holes at equal distance. I finally "stitched" my design with thread of the same color as the paint on the white side and with white thread on the paint.',
      text1: 'This first drawing represents two people kissing.',
      text2: 'The second drawing represents a woman\'s face.',
      text3: 'And finally, the third drawing represents a father and his two daughters.'

      text1: 'After experimenting, I found that the design I had fit well with the world of spa, massage, ... So I developed this idea and created a poster, a business card and a storefront.'
